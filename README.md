•	Customer segmentation is necessary to show ads targeted to a specific group with certain characteristics and for better overall customer experience with personalized experiences. This project aims to create distinct customer segments to enhance marketing strategies and customer engagement. 
•	Firstly, we opened the csv file containing our customer data with help of pandas library. Filled any missing values with 0 to ensure a complete dataset for model training, identified categorical columns and converted them to numerical values using label encoding from sklearn library. 
•	Then we applied K-Means clustering to the data and created 7 most distinguished clusters. We analyzed the model’s accuracy by calculating silhouette score which came out as 0.552 in my project indicating it’s a reasonable model.
